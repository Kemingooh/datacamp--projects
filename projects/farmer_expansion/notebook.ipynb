Farmers' Market Expansion\n","<p>You have been hired by a farming organisation that helps local farmers sell their products. They want to know whether they should open up a new farmers' market to sell dairy products from nearby farmers. They have supplied you with daily shopping data from a panel of local households from 2019 to 2020. </p>\n","<p>The organization will make their decision based on whether dairy products are popular in the area, and whether sales are trending in a positive direction. To answer these questions, they want three pieces of data:</p>\n","<ol>\n","<li>What was the total number of purchases of dairy products for each month of 2020 (i.e., the <code>total_sales</code>)?</li>\n","<li>What was the total share of dairy products (out of all products purchased) for each month of 2020 (i.e., the <code>market_share</code>)?</li>\n","<li>For each month of 2020, what was the percentage increase or decrease in total monthly dairy purchases compared to the same month in 2019 (i.e., the <code>year_change</code>)?</li>\n","</ol>\n","<p>The organization handles not only dairy farmers, but also those with chicken farms. As a result, they are only interested in these three categories (which they treat as dairy): ‘whole milk’, 'yogurt' and 'domestic eggs'.</p>\n","<p>The data you need is available in the tables shown in the database schema below.</p>\n","<h5 id=\"databaseschema\">Database Schema</h5>\n","<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5960/datasets/d3654b2e0ff3552364a70894d2b524d7ae9f47b1/db_schema_2.PNG\" alt=\"Database Schema\" width=\"400px\"></p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["%reload_ext sql"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["12 rows affected.\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["<table>\n","    <tr>\n","        <th>month</th>\n","        <th>total_sales</th>\n","        <th>market_share</th>\n","        <th>year_change</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>1</td>\n","        <td>228</td>\n","        <td>12.47</td>\n","        <td>48.05</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>2</td>\n","        <td>165</td>\n","        <td>11.11</td>\n","        <td>5.10</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>3</td>\n","        <td>216</td>\n","        <td>12.05</td>\n","        <td>27.81</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>4</td>\n","        <td>218</td>\n","        <td>13.09</td>\n","        <td>26.01</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>5</td>\n","        <td>195</td>\n","        <td>11.40</td>\n","        <td>17.47</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>6</td>\n","        <td>196</td>\n","        <td>10.94</td>\n","        <td>20.99</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>7</td>\n","        <td>195</td>\n","        <td>11.86</td>\n","        <td>-0.51</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>8</td>\n","        <td>231</td>\n","        <td>11.77</td>\n","        <td>32.00</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>9</td>\n","        <td>180</td>\n","        <td>11.16</td>\n","        <td>4.65</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>10</td>\n","        <td>193</td>\n","        <td>11.61</td>\n","        <td>17.68</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>11</td>\n","        <td>223</td>\n","        <td>12.55</td>\n","        <td>36.81</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","        <td>12</td>\n","        <td>162</td>\n","        <td>10.42</td>\n","        <td>8.72</td>\n","    </tr>\n","</table>"],"text/plain":["[(1, 228, Decimal('12.47'), Decimal('48.05')),\n"," (2, 165, Decimal('11.11'), Decimal('5.10')),\n"," (3, 216, Decimal('12.05'), Decimal('27.81')),\n"," (4, 218, Decimal('13.09'), Decimal('26.01')),\n"," (5, 195, Decimal('11.40'), Decimal('17.47')),\n"," (6, 196, Decimal('10.94'), Decimal('20.99')),\n"," (7, 195, Decimal('11.86'), Decimal('-0.51')),\n"," (8, 231, Decimal('11.77'), Decimal('32.00')),\n"," (9, 180, Decimal('11.16'), Decimal('4.65')),\n"," (10, 193, Decimal('11.61'), Decimal('17.68')),\n"," (11, 223, Decimal('12.55'), Decimal('36.81')),\n"," (12, 162, Decimal('10.42'), Decimal('8.72'))]"]},"execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["%%sql postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost/postgres\n","\n","    WITH cte_prep AS (\n","        SELECT\n","            EXTRACT(MONTH FROM COALESCE(p2019.full_date :: DATE, p2020.fulldate :: DATE)) :: INT AS month,\n","            COUNT(DISTINCT CASE\n","                            WHEN cat.category IN ('whole milk',\n","                                                    'yogurt',\n","                                                    'domestic eggs') THEN p2020.purchaseid END) AS dairy_2020_purchases,\n","            COUNT(DISTINCT CASE\n","                            WHEN cat.category IN ('whole milk',\n","                                                    'yogurt',\n","                                                    'domestic eggs') THEN p2019.purchase_id END) AS dairy_2019_purchases,\n","            COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN p2020.purchaseid IS NOT NULL THEN cat.purchase_id END) AS all_2020_purchases\n","        FROM categories cat\n","            LEFT JOIN purchases_2019 p2019 ON cat.purchase_id = p2019.purchase_id\n","            LEFT JOIN purchases_2020 p2020 ON cat.purchase_id = p2020.purchaseid\n","        GROUP BY 1\n","                    )\n","\n","    SELECT\n","        month,\n","        dairy_2020_purchases AS total_sales,\n","        ROUND(100.0 * dairy_2020_purchases / all_2020_purchases, 2) AS market_share,\n","        ROUND(((1.0 * dairy_2020_purchases / dairy_2019_purchases) -
