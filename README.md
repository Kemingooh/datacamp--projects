### Viewing notebooks with external visualisations

Sometimes, when libs like bokeh or folium are used, github notebooks will not display the content correctly

For this, one can use <https://nbviewer.org> and then paste in the full github repo's notebook URL

### Requirements

* Docker (Only for projects that require a DB)
* Python 3.7+

### Prepare venv

Download the repository, if you have not already

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jpuris/datacamp--projects.git
```

cd into the cloned repostiory

```sh
cd datacamp--projects
```

Make sure your python3 has virtualenv package installed

```sh
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
```

Create and activate python virtual environment

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install required python packages

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Only applicable for the projects that require DB setup

### Loading project data

*Only applicable for the projects that require DB setup* *!*

Start PostgreSQL server in a docker container

```sh
docker compose -f database/docker/docker-compose.yaml up
```

Run the ETL job for the project

```sh
python projects/<chosen project>/db_setup.py
```
